# Challenges

# Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 20.
    #PSEUDOCODE:
        # create a variable called nums, equal to 1
        # use a while loop w/ condition num < 20
        # print nums
    # nums = 1
    # while nums <= 20
    #     p nums
    #     nums += 1
    # end

# Write a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 20 using a different approach than previously used.
    #PSEUDOCODE:

        # nums = 20
        # while nums >= 1
        #     p nums
        #     nums -= 1
        # end

# Write a loop that prints only even numbers from 20 to 0.
        #PSEUDOCODE:
            # take our while loop from ^
            # add a conditional for even numbers
                # prints numbers
        # nums = 20
        # while nums >= 0
        #     if nums.even?
        #         p nums
        #     end
        #     nums -= 1
        # end
