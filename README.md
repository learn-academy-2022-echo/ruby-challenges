Challenges:

For the following Task challenge, use initialize and getter methods in your class


As a developer, I can create a class called Task.


As a developer, I can create three instances (objects) of class Task. (e.g laundry = Task.new)


As a developer, I can initialize each instance of class Task with a title.
As a developer, I can see the title of each instance of class Task.


As a developer, I can initialize each instance of class Task with a status that has a default value of 'incomplete'.



As a developer, I can update the status of each instance of class Task when the task has been completed.



For the following ColorPalette challenge use initialize and attr_accessor methods in your class



As a developer, I can create a class called ColorPalette.
As a developer, I can create three instances (objects) of class ColorPalette. (e.g green = ColorPalette.new)





As a developer, I can initialize each inistance of the class ColorPalette with three colors. (e.g. green = ColorPalette.new('Chartreuse', 'Kelly', 'Seafoam'))





As a developer, I can print the value of each individual color.



As a developer, I can create a method called all_colors that when called will print a sentence telling me the three colors of a given palette.



As a developer, I can change one or more colors of a given palette.


Animal Kingdom


As a developer, I can make an Animal (generic Animal class).



As a developer, upon initialization, I can give my Animal a status of alive, which will be set to true.



As a developer, I can give my Animal an age of 0 upon creation.



As a developer, I can age my Animal up one year at a time.
As a developer, I can return my Animal's age, as well as if they're alive.
Hint: Use attr_accessor as well as an initialize method.



As a developer, I can create a Fish that inherits from Animal.



As a developer, I can initialize all of my fish to be cold_blooded. (Yes, there is one fish who is technically fully warm-blooded but we aren't going to talk about that.)


As a developer, I can create a Salmon that inherits from Fish.


As a developer, I can initialize my Salmon to be a specific species (Atlantic, Sockeye, etc).



As a developer, I can see that my Salmon is cold-blooded.


As a developer, I can age my Salmon up.


As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my Salmon's information.



As a developer, if my Salmon reaches the ripe old age of 4, I can make it die peacefully after a full and happy life.
Hint: You will need a method that changes the status of alive in the initialize method of Animal.



As a developer, I can create a Mammal that inherits from Animal.



As a developer, I can initialize all of my Mammals to be warm_blooded.


As a developer, I can create a Bear that inherits from Mammal.



As a developer, I can age my Bear up.


As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my Bear's information.


As a developer, if my Bear turns 20 years old, I can make it die peacefully after a full and happy life.
Hint: You will need a method that changes the status of alive in the initialize method of Animal.
As a developer, I can create a Mammal of my choice.
As a developer, I can interact with the new Mammal via various methods.
As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my new Mammal's information.
STRETCH: As a developer, I can keep a collection of two of each Animal.
Hint: You'll want to add your Animals into an array.
STRETCH: As a developer, I can sort my collection of Animals based on age.
Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.
SUPER STRETCH: As a developer, I can utilize a Ruby module to help DRY up my code. I can create a swim method inside of my module that will apply to Animals who can swim. This method should return "I can swim!"
Hint: Look into module mix ins. Since not all animals can swim, only certain Animals will have access to this module.
